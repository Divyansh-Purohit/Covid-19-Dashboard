# Covid-19-Dashboard
This is a Covid-19 Dashboard. It displays the worldwide total confirmed cases, total recovered cases and the total deaths till date starting from 22nd of Januaury 2020. The datasets used in this project were prepared by John Hopekins University.

The users can get the counts of any country they select through the dropdown menu, and can adjust the graph using the slider.

This Dashboard is built using Dash, which is a framework for building web-based analytic applications and also provides pure Python abstraction around HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project relies on the dash_html_components library, the dash_bootstrap_components library and the dash_core_components library for built-in user interface elements. The graph is plotted using the ploty library.

To run this app on local machine simply download this notebook and run all cells in order and visit localhost:8050 in your browser.
